<title> Emma Ringwood Bio </title>
<body>
I am Emma Ringwood. My major is Information Management and Technology with a concentration in Digital Retail Strategies. Iâ€™m interested in combining IT and Retail. I have taken Python and SQL classes, along with other iSchool and Whitman courses. I love hanging out with friends and family, working out, and baking. I also like to watch TV and movies, so one of my favorite movies is How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.
