        <h1>My Favorite Current Trends</h1>
        <p>
            With being in quarantine this past spring, I’m sure everyone’s favorite item in their closet was sweatpants. Trust me though, me too. But recently people have been turning wearing sweatpants and sweatshirts in a cute, put-together look. I love this because a matching sweatsuit is extremely comfy and effortless. My favorite is the monochrome look that you can achieve by wearing a sweatshirt and pair of sweatpants that are the same colors. You can wear a matching sweat set to class, to just hang out, to run errands- all while still being comfortable

            Some of my favorite places to buy pieces for this look includes, Urban Outfitters, Aviator Nation, and Wildfox. Yet, there are so many options to buy a matching sweat suit anywhere. On the less expensive side you can go to Amazon, Target, and NastyGal. Sometimes the cheaper brands have the best finds!

            Another trend that I’ve been loving recently is jeans. As of last year people were still always wearing skinny jeans, which are not comfortable to wear for a long time. But now people are slowly starting to move away from that and are wearing jeans with a looser fit. Mom jeans, boyfriend jeans, and flare jeans are such a great new option that look very stylish. This new style of jeans go with almost all outfits and any shoe that you choose to pair them with.

            The best places to buy these are Levi’s, Zara, and Pistola Denim. These three places are all of different price points. Zara you can find jeans for around $30, Levi’s ranges, and Pistola are the most expensive but great quality! With Levi’s especially you can find great deals and they offer a student discount on their website for 15% off your purchase.
